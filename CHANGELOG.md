# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- Sparkle update checks now provide the appcast URL via `SPUUpdaterDelegate` as a runtime fallback, so "Check for Updates" works even when the generated `Info.plist` omits `SUFeedURL`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- Recording startup now validates microphone access before switching into the listening UI, so permission failures are surfaced instead of looking like a ready-but-dead recorder.
- Moonshine streaming now flushes buffered audio correctly on stop, preserves finalization errors instead of silently returning an empty transcript, and uses a mic capture path closer to Moonshine's upstream implementation.
- Engine readiness checks now verify the configured model directory rather than only the preset default path, preventing false "model ready" states in settings.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- Hardened hotkey lifecycle and shutdown behavior to avoid late callback execution during stop/quit, including idempotent teardown and eager overlay window warm-up.
- Updated synthetic event routing so insertion and paste remain configurable through `STENO_SYNTH_EVENT_TAP`, while media keys use a dedicated tap resolver with HID as the default.
- Improved subprocess execution reliability by streaming pipe output during process lifetime, adding cancellation escalation safeguards, and caching whisper process environment setup at engine initialization.
- Optimized local cleanup and replacement paths by precompiling reusable regexes, caching lexicon/snippet regexes with cache invalidation on mutation, and preserving longest-first lexicon ordering as an explicit invariant.
- Reduced history persistence overhead by removing pretty-printed JSON output formatting.

### Fixed
- Restored reliable media pause/resume behavior during dictation by routing media key posting through a dedicated HID-default tap path.
- Prevented event-tap re-enable thrash with debounce handling after timeout/user-input tap disable events.
- Added defensive teardown behavior for overlay timers and hotkey monitor resources during object deinitialization.
- Prevented potential deadlocks and cancellation stalls in process execution paths when child processes ignore graceful termination.

### Tests
- Added media key tap routing regression coverage for default, override, and invalid environment values.
- Hardened cancellation regression coverage to verify bounded completion when subprocesses ignore `SIGTERM`.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- Added `Steno/Steno.entitlements` and wired entitlements via `project.yml` for microphone access and DYLD environment behavior needed by local `whisper.cpp` builds.
- Added `StenoKitTestSupport` as a dedicated package target for test doubles used by `StenoKitTests`.

### Changed
- Updated insertion transport internals to use private event source state, async pacing (`Task.sleep`), and best-effort caret restoration after accessibility insertion.
- Updated permission and window behavior paths to be more predictable on macOS 13/14+, including safer main-window targeting and refreshed input-monitoring recheck flow.
- Moved persistent storage fallbacks for preferences/history to `~/Library/Application Support` (instead of temp storage) and reduced path visibility in logs.
- Updated app activation and SwiftUI `onChange` call sites to align with modern macOS APIs.

### Fixed
- Audio capture now surfaces recorder preparation/encoding failures and cleans temporary files on early failure paths.
- MediaRemote bridge teardown now drains callback queue before unloading framework handles.
- Overlay status-dot color transitions now animate through Core Animation transactions and respect live accessibility display option updates.
- Improved lock/continuation safety documentation in cancellation-sensitive concurrency paths.

### Removed
- Removed dead `TokenEstimator` utility.
- Removed production-exposed test adapter definitions from `StenoKit` main target and relocated them to `StenoKitTestSupport`.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Refreshed macOS app icon artwork in `Steno/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`.

### Changed
- Pivoted cleanup to local-only. Steno now runs transcription and cleanup fully on-device with no cloud cleanup mode.
- Removed API key onboarding/settings flow and cloud-mode status messaging to simplify setup and avoid mixed local/cloud behavior.
- Settings now use a draft-and-apply flow to avoid mutating preferences during view updates.
- Press-to-talk now attempts media interruption before starting audio capture.

### Fixed
- Media interruption detection now requires corroborating now-playing data before trusting playback-state-only signals. This prevents false `notPlaying` decisions when MediaRemote returns fallback state values with missing playback rate (including browser `Operation not permitted` probe paths).
- Weak-positive playback signals now require a short confirmation pass before sending play/pause, reducing phantom media launches when no audio is active.
- Preserved unknown-state safety behavior so playback control is skipped when media state is not trustworthy.

### Removed
- OpenAI cleanup integration (`OpenAICleanupEngine`) and remote cleanup wiring (`RemoteCleanupEngine`).
- Cloud budget and model-tier plumbing (`BudgetGuard`, cloud cleanup decision types, and cloud-only tests).

### Breaking for StenoKit Consumers
- `CleanupEngine.cleanup` removed the `tier` parameter.
- `CleanTranscript` removed `modelTier`.
- Cloud cleanup engines and budget types were removed from the package surface.

### Notes
- This release consolidates the media interruption hotfix work and local-only cleanup pivot into one tagged release (`v0.1.5`).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- First-pass macOS app icon set in `Steno/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` with a stenography-inspired glyph

### Removed
- Tracked generated Xcode project files (`Steno.xcodeproj/*`) from source control

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Benchmark tooling in `StenoKit` via `StenoBenchmarkCLI` and `StenoBenchmarkCore` (manifest parsing, run orchestration, scoring, report generation, and pipeline validation gates)
- Local cleanup candidate generation and ranking (`RuleBasedCleanupCandidateGenerator`, `LocalCleanupRanker`, and `CleanupRanking`)
- Polished README screenshots (`assets/record.png`, `assets/history.png`, `assets/settings-top.png`, and `assets/settings-bottom.png`)

### Changed
- Rule-based cleanup flow now integrates ranking-focused post-processing refinements for better transcript quality
- Onboarding and settings screens use clearer plain-language copy for first-run setup and configuration
- `README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` were reworked for clearer user and contributor onboarding

### Fixed
- Balanced filler cleanup preserves meaning-bearing uses of "like"
- Media interruption handling avoids phantom playback launches from stale/weak-positive playback signals

### Removed
- Security audit workflow and related badge from repository CI/docs

### Tests
- Expanded benchmark validation tests for scorer/report/pipeline gates
- Added cleanup accuracy and ranking behavior coverage
- Added media interruption regression coverage for stale signal handling
